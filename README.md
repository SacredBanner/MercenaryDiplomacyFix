# MercenaryDiplomacyFix
A bugfix mod for Mount & Blade 2: Bannerlord

When the player is a mercenary for a kingdom in 1.5.4 beta, the kingdom cannot declare war or make peace, due to a bug causing them to be unable to resolve kingdom decisions while the player is a mercenary for them. This mod fixes that bug.
